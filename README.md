# Dart Reactivity Benchmark [![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/reactivity_benchmark)](https://pub.dev/packages/reactivity_benchmark)

Benchmark comparing different standalone Dart reactivity/signals frameworks.

## Score Ranking

<!-- ranking start -->
| Rank | Framework | Score | Success Rate | Tests | Time |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| ðŸ¥‡ | alien_signals | 0.69 | 100.0% | 35/35 | 3.70s |
| ðŸ¥ˆ | preact_signals | 0.28 | 100.0% | 35/35 | 10.51s |
| ðŸ¥‰ | solidart(2.0-dev) | 0.27 | 100.0% | 35/35 | 5.31s |
| 4 | signals | 0.26 | 100.0% | 35/35 | 11.15s |
| 5 | mobx | 0.05 | 100.0% | 35/35 | 27.50s |
| 6 | state_beacon | 0.00 | 77.1% | 27/35 | 3.52s |

> [!TIP]
> ## Ranking algorithm
>
> The ranking system evaluates frameworks based on multiple factors:
>
> 1. **Test Case Scores**
>    - For each test case, the fastest passing implementation (with coefficient â‰¥ 0.5) serves as the baseline
>    - Individual test scores are calculated as: `(baseline_time / actual_time) * coefficient * weight`
>    - Test case weights are assigned based on operation types:
>      - Regular operations: 1.0
>      - Extended operations: 1.2-1.5
>
> 2. **Success Coefficient**
>    - Full pass (coefficient = 1.0): Test completely successful
>    - Partial pass (coefficient = 0.5): Part of the test failed
>    - Complete fail (coefficient = 0): Test failed entirely
>
> 3. **Final Score Calculation**
>    - Base score: Geometric mean of all weighted test case scores
>    - Time factor: sqrt(fastest_total_time / framework_total_time)
>    - Final score = base_score * time_factor
>
> This scoring system balances individual test performance with overall execution time while accounting for test reliability.
